**Philosophers Problem**

Imagine five philosophers at a table, each with a plate of spaghetti and a fork between each plate. They need two forks to eat, but they can only alternate between thinking, eating, and catching some Z's. A philosopher can chow down only when they have both the left and right fork, which happens when their neighbors are either deep in thought or snoozing. After a satisfying meal, they put down both forks and decide to take a nap and after to ponder life's mysteries. 

The challenge? Create a plan (a concurrent algorithm) that ensures no philosopher goes hungry, allowing them to keep cycling through eating, thinking, and sleeping, even though they have no clue when their buddies will do the same.
